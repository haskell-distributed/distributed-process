-- | This example demonstrates how a master can be connected to slaves using
-- the transport layer. After compiling, the following will initialize a new
-- master that waits for two clients to connect on the local machine:
--
--     ./DemoTCP 127.0.0.1 8080 sourceAddrFile 2
--
-- Following this, two slaves should be created that will connect to the master:
--
--     ./DemoTCP 127.0.0.1 8081 sourceAddrFile
--     ./DemoTCP 127.0.0.1 8082 sourceAddrFile
--
-- Once the connection is established, the slaves will provide the master
-- with their SourceAddr. The master then decodes this, and sends a message
-- back. After processing this message, the slaves respond to the master,
-- which then outputs some data.
