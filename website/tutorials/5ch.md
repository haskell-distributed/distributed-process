title: 5. Supervision Principles

### Introduction

In previous tutorial, we've looked at utilities for linking processes together
and monitoring their lifecycle as it changes. The ability to link and monitor are
foundational tools for building _reliable_ systems and are the bedrock principles
on which Cloud Haskell's supervision capabilities are built.

A `Supervisor` manages a set of _child processes_ throughout their entire lifecycle,
from birth (spawning) till death (exiting). Supervision is a key component in building
fault tolerant systems, providing applications with a structured way to recover from
isolated failures without the whole system crashing. Supervisors allow us to structure
our applications as independently managed subsystems, each with its own dependencies
(and inter-dependencies with other subsystems) and specify various policies determining
the fashion in which these subsystems are to be started, stopped (i.e., terminated)
and how they should behave at each level in case of failures.

Supervisors also provide a convenient means to shut down a system (or subsystem) in a
controlled fashion, since supervisors will always terminate their children before
exiting themselves and do so based on the policies supplied when they were initially
created.

### Quis custodiet ipsos custodes

Supervisors can be used to construct a tree of processes, where some children are
workers (e.g., regular processes) and others are themselves supervisors. Each supervisor
is responsible for monitoring its children and handling child failures by policy, as
well as deliberately terminating children when instructed to do so (either explicitly
per child, or when the supervisor is itself told to terminate).

Each supervisor takes with a list of _child specifications_, which tell the supervisor
how to interact with its children. Each specification provides the supervisor with the
following information about the corresponding child process:

1. `ChildKey`: used to identify the child specification and process (once it has started)
2. `ChildType`: indicates whether the child is a worker or another (nested) supervisor
3. `RestartPolicy`: tells the supervisor under what circumstances the child should be restarted
4. `ChildTerminationPolicy`: tells the supervisor how to terminate the child, should it need to
5. `ChildStart`: provides a means for the supervisor to start/spawn the child process

The `RestartPolicy` determines the circumstances under which a child should be
restarted when the supervisor detects that it has exited. A `Permanent` child will
always be restarted, whilst a `Temporary` child is never restarted. `Transient` children
are only restarted if the exit normally (i.e., the `DiedReason` the supervisor sees for
the child is `DiedNormal` rather than `DiedException`). `Intrinsic` children behave
exactly like `Transient` ones, except that if they terminate normally, the whole
supervisor (i.e., all the other children) exits normally as well, as if someone had
triggered the shutdown/terminate sequence for the supervisor's process explicitly.

When a supervisor is told directly to terminate a child process, it uses the
`ChildTerminationPolicy` to determine whether the child should be terminated
_gracefully_ or _brutally killed_. This _shutdown protocol_ is used throughout
[distributed-process-supervisor][dpp] and in order for a child process to be managed
effectively by its supervisor, it is imperative that it understands the protocol.
When a _graceful_ shutdown is required, the supervisor will send an exit signal to the
child process, with the `ExitReason` set to `ExitShutdown`, whence the child process is
expected to perform any required cleanup and then exit with the same `ExitReason`,
indicating that the shutdown happened cleanly/gracefully. On the other hand, when
the `RestartPolicy` is set to `TerminateImmediately`, the supervisor will not send
an exit signal at all, calling the `kill` primitive instead of the `exit` primitive.
This immediately kills the child process without giving it the opportunity to clean
up its internal state at all. The gracefull shutdown mode, `TerminateTimeout`, must
provide a timeout value. The supervisor attempts a _gracefull_ shutdown initially,
however if the child does not exit within the given time window, the supervisor will
automatically revert to a _brutal kill_ using `TerminateImmediately`. If the
timeout value is set to `Infinity`, the supervisor will wait indefintiely for the
child to exit cleanly.

When a supervisor detects a child exit, it will attempt a restart. Whilst explicitly
terminating a child will **only** terminate the specified child process, unexpected
child exits can trigger a _branch restart_, where other (sibling) child processes are
restarted along with the child that failed. How the supervisor goes about this
_branch restart_ is governed by the `RestartStrategy` given when the supervisor is
first started.

### Isolated Restarts

The `RestartOne` strategy is very simple. When one child fails, only that individual
child is restarted and its siblings are left running. Use `RestartOne` whenever the
processes being supervised are completely independent of one another, or a child can
be restarted and lose it's state without adversely affecting its siblings.

### All or nothing restarts

The `RestartAll` strategy is used when our children are all inter-dependent and it's
necessary to restart them all whenever one child crashes. This strategy triggers one of
those _branch restarts_ we mentioned earlier, which in this case means that **all** the
supervisor's children are restarted if any child fails.

The order and manner in which the surviving children are restarted depends on the chosen
`RestartMode` which parameterises the `RestartStrategy`. This comes in three flavours:

1. `RestartEach`: stops then starts each child sequentially
2. `RestartInOrder`: stops all children first (in order), then restarts them sequentially
3. `RestartRevOrder`: stops all children in one order, then restarts them sequentially in the opposite

Each `RestartMode` is further parameterised by its `RestartOrder`, which is either left
to righ, or right to left. To illustrate, we will consider three alternative configurations
here, starting with `RestartEach` and `LeftToRight`.

There are times when we need to shut down all the children first, before restarting them.
The `RestartInOrder` mode will do this, shutting the children down according to our chosen
`RestartOrder` and then starting them up in the same way. Here's an example demonstrating
`RestartInOrder` using `LeftToRight`.

-------
![Sup3: ][sup3]
-------

If we'd chosen `RightToLeft`, the children would have been stopped from right to left (i.e.,
starting with child-3, then child-2, etc) and then restarted in the same order.

The astute reader might've noticed that so far, we've yet to demonstrate the behaviour that's
default in [Erlang/OTP's Supervisor][erlsup], and it's a default for good reason. It is not
uncommon for children to depend on one another and therefore need to be started in the correct
order. Since these children rely on their siblings to function, we must stop them in the opposite
order, otherwise the dependent children might crash whilst we're restarting other processes they
rely on. It follows that, in this setup, we cannot subsequently (re)start the children in the
same order we stopped them either.
