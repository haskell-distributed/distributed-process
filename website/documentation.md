### Cloud Haskell Platform

This is the [*Cloud Haskell Platform*][cloud-haskell]. Cloud Haskell is a set of libraries
that bring Erlang-style concurrency and distribution to Haskell programs. This
project is an implementation of that distributed computing interface, where
processes communicate with one another through explicit message passing rather
than shared memory.

Originally described by the joint [Towards Haskell in the Cloud][haskell11-ch] paper,
Cloud Haskell has be re-written from the ground up and supports a rich and
growing number of features for

* building concurrent applications using asynchronous message passing
* building distributed computing applications
* building fault tolerant systems
* running Cloud Haskell nodes on various network transports
* working with several network transport implementations (and more in the pipeline)
* supporting *static* values (required for remote communication)

There is a
[presentation][fun201202-coutts]
on Cloud Haskell and this reimplementation, which is worth reading in conjunction
with the documentation and wiki pages on this website..

Cloud Haskell comprises the following components, some of which are complete,
others experimental. There are three main parts:

#### The core libraries

* [distributed-process][distributed-process]: Base concurrency and distribution support. It provides a number of primitives known from Erlang like `link` and `monitor`.
* [distributed-static][distributed-static]: Support for static values
* [rank1dynamic][rank1dynamic]: Like `Data.Dynamic` and `Data.Typeable` but supporting polymorphic values

#### The platform libraries

* [distributed-process-client-server][distributed-process-client-server]: Common client/server patterns like Erlang's `gen_server`
* [distributed-process-async][distributed-process-async]: Future-style computations
* [distributed-process-task][distributed-process-task]: A worker queue
* [distributed-process-extras][distributed-process-extras]: Monitoring, logging, resolving names etc.
* [distributed-process-registry][distributed-process-registry]: A key-value registry
* [distributed-process-execution][distributed-process-execution]: Load regulation, work shedding, hand-off etc.

#### The network layer

* [network-transport][network-transport]: Generic `Network.Transport` API
* [network-transport-tcp][network-transport-tcp]: TCP realisation of `Network.Transport`
* [network-transport-inmemory][network-transport-inmemory]: In-memory realisation of `Network.Transport` (incomplete)
* [network-transport-composed][network-transport-composed]: Compose two transports (very preliminary)
* [distributed-process-simplelocalnet][distributed-process-simplelocalnet]: Simple backend for local networks
* [distributed-process-azure][distributed-process-azure]: Azure backend for Cloud Haskell (proof of concept)

One of Cloud Haskell's goals is to separate the transport layer from the
*process layer*, so that the transport backend is entirely independent. In fact
other projects can and do reuse the transport layer, even if they don't use or
have their own process layer (see e.g. [HdpH][hdph]).

Abstracting over the transport layer allows different protocols for
message passing, including TCP/IP, UDP,
[MPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface),
[CCI](http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-interface/),
[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org), [SSH](http://openssh.com), MVars, Unix pipes, and more. Each of these transports provides
its own implementation of the `Network.Transport` API and provide a means of creating
new connections for use within `Control.Distributed.Process`.

The following diagram shows dependencies between the various subsystems,
in an application using Cloud Haskell, where arrows represent explicit
directional dependencies.

In this diagram, the various nodes roughly correspond to specific modules:

    Cloud Haskell                : Control.Distributed.Process
    Cloud Haskell                : Control.Distributed.Process.*
    Transport Interface          : Network.Transport
    Transport Implementation     : Network.Transport.*

An application is built using the primitives provided by the Cloud
Haskell layer, provided by the `Control.Distributed.Process` module, which
defines abstractions such as nodes and processes.

The application also depends on a Cloud Haskell Backend, which
provides functions to allow the initialisation of the transport layer
using whatever topology might be appropriate to the application.

It is, of course, possible to create new Cloud Haskell nodes by
using a Network Transport Backend such as `Network.Transport.TCP`
directly.

The Cloud Haskell interface and backend make use of the Transport
interface provided by the `Network.Transport` module.
This also serves as an interface for the `Network.Transport.*`
module, which provides a specific implementation for this transport,
and may, for example, be based on some external library written in
Haskell or C.

### Network Transport Abstraction Layer

Cloud Haskell's generic [network-transport][network-transport] API is entirely independent of
the concurrency and messaging passing capabilities of the *process layer*.
Cloud Haskell applications are built using the primitives provided by the
*process layer* (i.e., [distributed-process][distributed-process]), which provides abstractions
such as nodes and processes. Applications must also depend on a Cloud Haskell
backend, which provides functions to allow the initialisation of the transport
layer using whatever topology might be appropriate to the application.

`Network.Transport` is a network abstraction layer geared towards specific
classes of applications, offering the following high level concepts:

* Nodes in the network are represented by `EndPoint`s. These are heavyweight stateful objects.
* Each `EndPoint` has an `EndPointAddress`.
* Connections can be established from one `EndPoint` to another using the `EndPointAddress` of the remote end.
* The `EndPointAddress` can be serialised and sent over the network, whereas `EndPoint`s and connections cannot.
* Connections between `EndPoint`s are unidirectional and lightweight.
* Outgoing messages are sent via a `Connection` object that represents the sending end of the connection.
* Incoming messages for **all** of the incoming connections on an `EndPoint` are collected via a shared receive queue.
* In addition to incoming messages, `EndPoint`s are notified of other `Event`s such as new connections or broken connections.

This design was heavily influenced by the design of the Common Communication Interface ([CCI](http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-interface/)). Important design goals are:

* Connections should be lightweight: it should be no problem to create thousands of connections between endpoints.
* Error handling is explicit: every function declares as part of its type which errors it can return (no exceptions are thrown)
* Error handling is "abstract": errors that originate from implementation specific problems (such as "no more sockets" in the TCP implementation) get mapped to generic errors ("insufficient resources") at the Transport level.

For the purposes of most Cloud Haskell applications, it is sufficient to know
enough about the `Network.Transport` API to instantiate a backend with the
required configuration and pass the returned opaque handle to the `Node` API
in order to establish a new, connected, running node. More involved setups are,
of course, possible; The simplest use of the API is thus

{% highlight haskell %}
main :: IO
main = do
  Right transport <- createTransport "127.0.0.1" "10080" defaultTCPParameters
  node1 <- newLocalNode transport initRemoteTable
{% endhighlight %}

Here we can see that the application depends explicitly on the
`defaultTCPParameters` and `createTransport` functions from
`Network.Transport.TCP`, but little else. The application *can* make use
of other `Network.Transport` APIs if required, but for the most part this
is irrelevant and the application will interact with Cloud Haskell through
the *Process Layer* and *Platform*.

For more details about `Network.Transport` please see the [wiki page](/wiki/networktransport.html).

### Concurrency and Distribution

The *Process Layer* is where Cloud Haskell's support for concurrency and
distributed programming are exposed to application developers. This layer
deals explicitly with

The core of Cloud Haskell's concurrency and distribution support resides in the
[distributed-process][distributed-process] library. As well as the APIs necessary for starting
nodes and forking processes on them, we find all the basic primitives required
to

* spawn processes locally and remotely
* send and receive messages, optionally using typed channels
* monitor and/or link to processes, channels and other nodes

Most of this is easy enough to follow in the haddock documentation and the
various tutorials. Here we focus on the essential *concepts* behind the
process layer.

A concurrent process is somewhat like a Haskell thread - in fact it is a
`forkIO` thread - but one that can send and receive messages through its
*process mailbox*. Each process can send messages asynchronously to other
processes, and can receive messages synchronously from its own mailbox.
The conceptual difference between threads and processes is that the latter
do not share state, but communicate only via message passing.

Code that is executed in this manner must run in the `Process` monad. Our
process will look like any other monad code, plus we provide and instance
of `MonadIO` for `Process`, so you can `liftIO` to make IO actions
available.

Processes reside on nodes, which in our implementation map directly to the
`Control.Distributed.Processes.Node` module. Given a configured
`Network.Transport` backend, starting a new node is fairly simple:

{% highlight haskell %}
newLocalNode :: Transport -> IO LocalNode
{% endhighlight %}

Once this function returns, the node will be *up and running* and able to
interact with other nodes and host processes. It is possible to start more
than one node in the same running program, though if you do this they will
continue to send messages to one another using the supplied `Network.Transport`
backend.

Given a new node, there are two primitives for starting a new process.

{% highlight haskell %}
forkProcess :: LocalNode -> Process () -> IO ProcessId
runProcess  :: LocalNode -> Process () -> IO ()
{% endhighlight %}

Once we've spawned some processes, they can communicate with one another
using the messaging primitives provided by [distributed-process][distributed-process],
which are well documented in the haddocks.

### What is Serializable

Processes can send data if the type implements the `Serializable` typeclass,
which is done indirectly by implementing `Binary` and deriving `Typeable`.
Implementations are already provided for primitives and some commonly used
data structures. As programmers, we see the messages in nice high-level form
(e.g., `Int`, `String`, `Ping`, `Pong`, etc), however these data have to be
encoded in order to be sent over a communications channel.

Not all types are `Serializable`, for example concurrency primitives such as
`MVar` and `TVar` are meaningless outside the context of threads with a shared
memory. Cloud Haskell programs remain free to use these constructs within
processes or within processes on the same machine though. If you want to
pass data between processes using *ordinary* concurrency primitives such as
`STM` then you're free to do so. Processes spawned locally can share
types such as `TMVar` just as normal Haskell threads would.

### Typed Channels

Channels provides an alternative to message transmission with `send` and `expect`.
While `send` and `expect` allow us to transmit messages of any `Serializable`
type, channels require a uniform type. Channels work like a distributed equivalent
of Haskell's `Control.Concurrent.Chan`, however they have distinct ends: a single
receiving port and a corollary send port.

Channels provide a nice alternative to *bare send and receive*, which is a bit
*un-Haskell-ish*, since our process' message queue can contain messages of multiple
types, forcing us to undertake dynamic type checking at runtime.

We create channels with a call to `newChan`, and send/receive on them using the
`{send,receive}Chan` primitives:

{% highlight haskell %}
channelsDemo :: Process ()
channelsDemo = do
    (sp, rp) <- newChan :: Process (SendPort String, ReceivePort String)

    -- send on a channel
    spawnLocal $ sendChan sp "hello!"

    -- receive on a channel
    m <- receiveChan rp
    say $ show m
{% endhighlight %}

Channels are particularly useful when you are sending a message that needs a
response, because we know exactly where to look for the reply.

Channels can also allow message types to be simplified, as passing a
`ProcessId` for the reply isn't required. Channels aren't so useful when we
need to spawn a process and send a bunch a messages to it, then wait for
replies however; we can’t send a `ReceivePort` since it is not `Serializable`.

`ReceivePort`s can be merged, so we can listen on several simultaneously. In the
latest version of [distributed-process][distributed-process], we can listen for *regular* messages
and multiple channels at the same time, using `matchChan` in the list of
allowed matches passed `receiveWait` and `receiveTimeout`.

### Linking and monitoring

Processes can be linked to other processes, nodes or channels. Links are unidirectional,
and guarantee that once the linked object *dies*, the linked process will also be
terminated. Monitors do not cause the *listening* process to exit, but rather they
put a `ProcessMonitorNotification` into the process' mailbox. Linking and monitoring
are foundational tools for *supervising* processes, where a top level process manages
a set of children, starting, stopping and restarting them as necessary.

### Stopping Processes

Because processes are implemented with `forkIO` we might be tempted to stop
them by throwing an asynchronous exception to the process, but this is almost
certainly the wrong thing to do. Firstly, processes might reside on a remote
node, in which case throwing an exception is impossible. Secondly, if we send
some messages to a process' mailbox and then dispatch an exception to kill it,
there is no guarantee that the subject will receive our message before being
terminated by the asynchronous exception.

To terminate a process unconditionally, we use the `kill` primitive, which
dispatches an asynchronous exception (killing the subject) safely, respecting
remote calls to processes on disparate nodes and observing message ordering
guarantees such that `send pid "hello" >> kill pid "goodbye"` behaves quite
unsurprisingly, delivering the message before the kill signal.

Exit signals come in two flavours however - those that can be caught and those
that cannot. Whilst a call to `kill` results in an _un-trappable_ exception,
a call to `exit :: (Serializable a) => ProcessId -> a -> Process ()` will dispatch
an exit signal to the specified process that can be caught. These *signals* are
intercepted and handled by the destination process using `catchExit`, allowing
the receiver to match on the `Serializable` datum tucked away in the *exit signal*
and decide whether to oblige or not.

### Rethinking the Task Layer

[Towards Haskell in the Cloud][haskell11-ch] describes a multi-layered architecture, in
which manipulation of concurrent processes and message passing between them
is managed in the *process layer*, whilst a higher level API described as the
*task layer* provides additional features such as

* automatic recovery from failures
* data centric processing model
* a promise (or *future*) abstraction, representing the result of a calculation that may or may not have yet completed

The [distributed-process-task][distributed-process-task] library implements parts of the
*task layer*, but takes a very different approach to that described
in the original paper and implemented by the [remote][remote] package. In particular,
we diverge from the original design and defer to many of the principles
defined by Erlang's [Open Telecom Platform][OTP], taking in some well established
Haskell concurrency design patterns along the way.

In fact, [distributed-process-async][distributed-process-async] does not really consider the
*task layer* in great detail. We provide an API comparable to remote's
`Promise` in `Control.Distributed.Process.Async`. This API however,
is derived from Simon Marlow's [Control.Concurrent.Async][async] package, and is not
limited to blocking queries on `Async` handles in the same way. Instead our
[API][d-p-async-async] handles both blocking and non-blocking queries, polling
and working with lists of `Async` handles. We also eschew throwing exceptions
to indicate asynchronous task failures, instead handling *task* and connectivity
failures using monitors. Users of the API need only concern themselves with the
`AsyncResult`, which encodes the status and (possibly) outcome of the computation
simply.

------

{% highlight haskell %}
demoAsync :: Process ()
demoAsync = do
  -- spawning a new task is fairly easy - this one is linked
  -- so if the caller dies, the task is killed too
  hAsync :: Async String
  hAsync <- asyncLinked $ (expect >>= return) :: Process String

  -- there is a rich API of functions to query an async handle
  AsyncPending <- poll hAsync   -- not finished yet

  -- we can cancel the task if we want to
  -- cancel hAsync

  -- or cancel it and wait until it has exited
  -- cancelWait hAsync

  -- we can wait on the task and timeout if it's still busy
  Nothing <- waitTimeout (within 3 Seconds) hAsync

  -- or finally, we can block until the task is finished!
  asyncResult <- wait hAsync
  case asyncResult of
      (AsyncDone res) -> say (show res)  -- a finished task/result
      AsyncCancelled  -> say "it was cancelled!?"
      AsyncFailed (DiedException r) -> say $ "it failed: " ++ (show r)
{% endhighlight %}

------

Unlike remote's task layer, we do not exclude IO, allowing tasks to run in
the `Process` monad and execute arbitrary code. Providing a monadic wrapper
around `Async` that disallows side effects is relatively simple, and we
do not consider the presence of side effects a barrier to fault tolerance
and automated process restarts. Erlang does not forbid *IO* in its processes,
and yet that doesn't render supervision trees ineffective. They key is to
provide a rich enough API that stateful processes can recognise whether or
not they need to provide idempotent initialisation routines.

The utility of preventing side effects using the type system is, however, not
to be sniffed at. A substrate of the `ManagedProcess` API is under development
that provides a *safe process* abstraction in which side effect free computations
can be embedded, whilst reaping the benefits of the framework.

Work is also underway to provide abstractions for managing asynchronous tasks
at a higher level, focussing on workload distribution and load regulation.

The kinds of task that can be performed by the async implementations in
[distributed-process-async][distributed-process-async] are limited only by their return type:
it **must** be `Serializable` - that much should've been obvious by now.
The type of asynchronous task definitions comes in two flavours, one for
local nodes which require no remote-table or static serialisation dictionary,
and another for tasks you wish to execute on remote nodes.

{% highlight haskell %}
-- | A task to be performed asynchronously.
data AsyncTask a =
    AsyncTask
      {
        asyncTask :: Process a -- ^ the task to be performed
      }
  | AsyncRemoteTask
      {
        asyncTaskDict :: Static (SerializableDict a)
          -- ^ the serializable dict required to spawn a remote process
      , asyncTaskNode :: NodeId
          -- ^ the node on which to spawn the asynchronous task
      , asyncTaskProc :: Closure (Process a)
          -- ^ the task to be performed, wrapped in a closure environment
      }
{% endhighlight %}

The API for `Async` is fairly rich, so reading the haddocks is suggested.

#### Managed Processes

The main idea behind a `ManagedProcess` is to separate the functional
and non-functional aspects of an actor. By functional, we mean whatever
application specific task the actor performs, and by non-functional
we mean the *concurrency* or, more precisely, handling of the process'
mailbox and its interaction with other actors (i.e., clients).

Looking at *typed channels*, we noted that their insistence on a specific input
domain was more *haskell-ish* than working with bare send and receive primitives.
The `Async` sub-package also provides a type safe interface for receiving data,
although it is limited to running a computation and waiting for its result.

The [Control.Distributed.Processes.Platform.ManagedProcess][d-p-client-server-ManagedProcess] API provides a
number of different abstractions that can be used to achieve similar benefits
in your code. It works by introducing a standard protocol between your process
and the *world outside*, which governs how to handle request/reply processing,
exit signals, timeouts, sleeping/hibernation with `threadDelay` and even provides
hooks that terminating processes can use to clean up residual state.

The [API documentation][d-p-client-server-ManagedProcess] is quite extensive, so here we will simply point
out the obvious differences. A process implemented with `ManagedProcess`
can present a type safe API to its callers (and the server side code too!),
although that's not its primary benefit. For a very simplified example:

{% highlight haskell %}
add :: ProcessId -> Double -> Double -> Process Double
add sid x y = call sid (Add x y)

divide :: ProcessId -> Double -> Double
          -> Process (Either DivByZero Double)
divide sid x y = call sid (Divide x y )

launchMathServer :: Process ProcessId
launchMathServer =
  let server = statelessProcess {
      apiHandlers = [
          handleCall_   (\(Add    x y) -> return (x + y))
        , handleCallIf_ (input (\(Divide _ y) -> y /= 0)) handleDivide
        , handleCall_   (\(Divide _ _) -> divByZero)
        ]
    }
  in spawnLocal $ start () (statelessInit Infinity) server >> return ()
  where handleDivide :: Divide -> Process (Either DivByZero Double)
        handleDivide (Divide x y) = return $ Right $ x / y

        divByZero :: Process (Either DivByZero Double)
        divByZero = return $ Left DivByZero
{% endhighlight %}

Apart from the types and the imports, that is a complete definition. Whilst
it's not so obvious what's going on here, the key point is that the invocation
of `call` in the client facing API functions handles **all** of the relevant
waiting/blocking, converting the async result and so on. Note that the
*managed process* does not interact with its mailbox at all, but rather
just provides callback functions which take some state and either return a
new state and a reply, or just a new state. The process is *managed* in the
sense that its mailbox is under someone else's control.

A NOTE ABOUT THE CALL API AND THAT IT WILL FAIL (WITH UNHANDLED MESSAGE) IF
THE CALLER IS EXPECTING A TYPE THAT DIFFERS FROM THE ONE THE SERVER PLANS
TO RETURN, SINCE THE RETURN TYPE IS ENCODED IN THE CALL-MESSAGE TYPE ITSELF.

TODO: WRITE A TEST TO PROVE THE ABOVE

TODO: ADD AN API BASED ON SESSION TYPES AS A KIND OF MANAGED PROCESS.....

In a forthcoming tutorial, we'll look at the `Control.Distributed.Process.Platform.Task`
API, which looks a lot like `Async` but manages exit signals in a single thread and makes
configurable task pools and task supervision strategy part of its API.

More complex examples of the `ManagedProcess` API can be seen in the
[Managed Processes tutorial](tutorials/4ch.html). API documentation for HEAD is available
[here][d-p-client-server-ManagedProcess].
