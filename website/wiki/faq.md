### FAQ

#### Do I need to install a network-transport backend?

Yes. The `Network.Transport` component provides only the API - an actual
backend that implements this will be required in order to start a CH node.

#### What guarantees are there for message ordering, sending, etc

Take a look at the formal semantics for answers to *all* such questions.
They're actually quite pithy and readable, and fairly honest about where
there are still gaps.

You can find them via the *resources* tab just above this page.

### Help

If the documentation doesn't answer your question, queries about Cloud Haskell
can be directed to the Parallel Haskell Mailing List
(parallel-haskell@googlegroups.com), which is pretty active. If you think
you've found a bug, or would like to request a new feature, please visit the
[github](https://github.com/haskell-distributed) repositories and submit a bug.

### Getting Involved

If you're interested in hacking Cloud Haskell then please read the
[Contributing](/wiki/contributing.html) wiki page. Additional help can be obtained through the
[Developers Forum/Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/cloud-haskell-developers)
or Parallel Haskell mailing list.
