    -- "bundle" of connections, with only a single "bundle" of connections per
    -- endpoint at any point in time.
    --
    -- That is, suppose there are multiple connections in either direction
    -- between endpoints A and B, and A receives a notification that it has
    -- lost contact with B. Then A must not be able to send any further
    -- messages to B on existing connections.
    --
    -- Although B may not realize /immediately/ that its connection to A has
    -- been broken, messages sent by B on existing connections should not be
    -- delivered, and B must eventually get an EventConnectionLost message,
    -- too.
    --
    -- Moreover, this event must be posted before A has successfully
    -- reconnected (in other words, if B notices a reconnection attempt from A,
    -- it must post the EventConnectionLost before acknowledging the connection
    -- from A) so that B will not receive events about new connections or
    -- incoming messages from A without realizing that it got disconnected.
    --
    -- If B attempts to establish another connection to A before it realized
    -- that it got disconnected from A then it's okay for this connection
    -- attempt to fail, and the EventConnectionLost to be posted at that point,
    -- or for the EventConnectionLost to be posted and for the new connection
    -- to be considered the first connection of the "new bundle".
