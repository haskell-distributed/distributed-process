MAJOR TODOs (in no particular order)

- implement Observable for Mailbox
- implement PCopy / pcopy :: PCopy a -> Process () and precv :: Process (Maybe (PCopy a))
- provide InputChannel for PCopy data, i.e.:

data InputChannel a = ReadChan (ReceivePort a) | ReadSTM (STM a)

read (ReadChan rp)  = expectChan rp
read (ReadSTM  stm) = liftIO $ atomically stm

offer 

- implement RoundRobinRouter, ContentBasedRouter
- finish off ResourcePool
- double check we're using NFSerializable where possible/necessary

- implement LocalRegistry (?)
- possibly rationalise Registry with LocalRegistry (?)
- Health checks for services
- Service Monitoring
