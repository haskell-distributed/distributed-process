-- [Tracing/Debugging Facilities]
--
-- Cloud Haskell provides a general purpose tracing mechanism, allowing a
-- user supplied /tracer process/ to receive messages when certain classes of
-- system events occur. It's possible to use this facility to aid in debugging
-- and/or perform other diagnostic tasks to a program at runtime.
--
-- [Enabling Tracing]
--
-- Throughout the lifecycle of a local node, the distributed-process runtime
-- generates /trace events/, describing internal runtime activities such as
-- the spawning and death of processes, message sending, delivery and so on.
-- See the 'MxEvent' type's documentation for a list of all the published
-- event types, which correspond directly to the types of /management/ events.
-- Users can additionally publish custom trace events in the form of
-- 'MxLog' log messages or pass custom (i.e., completely user defined)
-- event data using the 'traceMessage' function.
--
-- All published traces are forwarded to a /tracer process/, which can be
-- specified (and changed) at runtime using 'traceEnable'. Some pre-defined
-- tracer processes are provided for conveniently printing to stderr, a log file
-- or the GHC eventlog.
--
-- If a tracer process crashes, no attempt is made to restart it.
--
-- [Working with multiple tracer processes]
--
-- The tracing facility only ever writes to a single tracer process. This
-- invariant insulates the tracer controller and ensures a fast path for
-- handling all trace events. /This/ module provides facilities for layering
-- trace handlers using Cloud Haskell's built-in delegation primitives.
--
-- The 'startTracer' function wraps the registered @tracer@ process with the
-- supplied handler and also forwards trace events to the original tracer.
-- The corresponding 'stopTracer' function terminates tracer processes in
-- reverse of the order in which they were started, and re-registers the
-- previous tracer process.
--
-- [Built in tracers]
--
-- The built in tracers provide a simple /logging/ facility that writes trace
-- events out to either a log file, @stderr@ or the GHC eventlog. These tracers
-- can be configured using environment variables, or specified manually using
-- the 'traceEnable' function.
--
-- When a new local node is started, the contents of several environment
-- variables are checked to determine which default tracer process is selected.
-- If none of these variables is set, a no-op tracer process is installed,
-- which effectively ignores all trace messages. Note that in this case,
-- trace events are still generated and passed through the system.
-- Only one default tracer will be chosen - the first that contains a (valid)
-- value. These environment variables, in the order they're examined, are:
--
-- 1. @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_FILE@
-- This is checked for a valid file path. If it exists and the file can be
-- opened for writing, all trace output will be directed thence. If the supplied
-- path is invalid, or the file is unavailable for writing, this tracer will not
-- be selected.
--
-- 2. @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_CONSOLE@
-- This is checked for /any/ non-empty value. If set, then all trace output will
-- be directed to the system logger process.
--
-- 3. @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_EVENTLOG@
-- This is checked for /any/ non-empty value. If set, all internal traces are
-- written to the GHC eventlog.
--
-- By default, the built in tracers will ignore all trace events! In order to
-- enable tracing the incoming 'MxEvent' stream, the @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_FLAGS@
-- environment variable accepts the following flags, which enable tracing specific
-- event types:
--
--  * @p@ = trace the spawning of new processes
--  * @d@ = trace the death of processes
--  * @n@ = trace registration of names (i.e., named processes)
--  * @u@ = trace un-registration of names (i.e., named processes)
--  * @s@ = trace the sending of messages to other processes
--  * @r@ = trace the receipt of messages from other processes
--  * @l@ = trace node up/down events
--
-- Users of the /simplelocalnet/ Cloud Haskell backend should also note that
-- because the trace file option only supports trace output from a single node
-- (so as to avoid interleaving), a file trace configured for the master node
-- will prevent slaves from tracing to the file. They will need to fall back to
-- the console or eventlog tracers instead, which can be accomplished by setting
-- one of these environment variables /as well/, since the latter will only be
-- selected on slaves (when the file tracer selection fails).
--
-- Support for writing to the eventlog requires specific intervention to work,
-- without which, written traces are silently dropped/ignored and no output will
-- be generated. The GHC eventlog documentation provides information about
-- enabling, viewing and working with event traces at
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/EventLog>.
