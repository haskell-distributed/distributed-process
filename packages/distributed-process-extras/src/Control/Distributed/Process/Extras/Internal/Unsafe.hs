-- | If you don't know exactly what this module is for and precisely
-- how to use the types within, you should move on, quickly!
--
-- [Implementation Notes]
-- This module provides facilities for forcibly sending non-serializable
-- data via cloud haskell's messaging primitives, such as @send@ et al.
-- Of course, if you attmept to do this when interacting with a remote process,
-- your application will break.
--
-- NB: this module will be deprecated in the next dot release, pending rewrite
-- of the libraries that currently rely on it, to use the new supporting APIs
-- for STM interactions in distributed-process-client-server.

-- NB: PCopy is a shim, allowing us to copy a pointer to otherwise
-- non-serializable data directly to another local process'
-- mailbox with no serialisation or even deepseq evaluation
-- required. We disallow remote queries (i.e., from other nodes)
-- and thus the Binary instance below is never used (though it's
-- required by the type system) and will in fact generate errors if
-- you attempt to use it at runtime. In other words, if you attempt
-- to make a @Message@ out of this, you'd better make sure you're
-- calling @unsafeCreateUnencodedMessage@, otherwise /BOOM/! You have
-- been warned.
