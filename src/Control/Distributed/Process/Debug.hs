-- [Tracing/Debugging Facilities]
--
-- Cloud Haskell provides a general purpose tracing mechanism, allowing a
-- user supplied /tracer process/ to receive messages when certain classes of
-- system events occur. It's possible to use this facility to aid in debugging
-- and/or perform other diagnostic tasks to a program at runtime.
--
-- [Enabling Tracing]
--
-- Tracing is disabled by default, because it carries a relatively small, but
-- tangible cost. To enable tracing, the environment variable
-- @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_ENABLED@ must be set to some value (actual content
-- is ignored). When the environment variable /is/ set, the system will
-- generate /trace events/ in various circumstances - see 'TraceEvent' for a
-- list of all the published events. A user can additionally publish custom
-- trace events in the form of 'TraceEvLog' log messages or pass custom
-- (i.e., completely user defined) event data using the 'traceMessage' function.
-- If the environment variable is not set, no trace events will ever be
-- published.
--
-- All published traces are forwarded to a /tracer process/, which can be
-- specified (and changed) at runtime using 'traceEnable'. Some pre-defined
-- tracer processes are provided for conveniently printing to stderr, a log file
-- or the GHC eventlog.
--
-- If a tracer process crashes, no attempt is made to restart it.
--
-- [Working with multiple tracer processes]
--
-- The system tracing facility only ever writes to a single tracer process. This
-- invariant insulates the tracer controller and ensures a fast path for
-- handling all trace events. /This/ module provides facilities for layering
-- trace handlers using Cloud Haskell's built-in delegation primitives.
--
-- The 'startTracer' function wraps the registered @tracer@ process with the
-- supplied handler and also forwarding trace events to the original tracer.
-- The corresponding 'stopTracer' function terminates tracer processes in
-- reverse of the order in which they were started, and re-establishes the
-- previous tracer process.
--
-- [Built in tracers]
--
-- The built in tracers provide a simple /logging/ facility that writes trace
-- events out to either a log file, @stderr@ or the GHC eventlog. These tracers
-- can be configured using environment variables, or specified manually using
-- the 'traceEnable' function. The base tracer process cannot be
--
-- When a new local node is started, the contents of several environment
-- variables are checked to determine how the default tracer process
-- will handle trace events. If none of these variables is set, then the
-- trace events will be effectively ignored, although they will still be
-- generated and passed through the system. Only one configuration will be
-- chosen - the first that contains a (valid) value. These environment
-- variables, in the order they're checked, are:
--
-- 1. @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_FILE@
-- This is checked for a valid file path. If it exists and the file can be
-- opened for writing, all trace output will be directed thence. If the supplied
-- path is invalid, or the file is unavailable for writing - e.g., because
-- another node has already started tracing to it - then this tracer will be
-- disabled.
--
-- 2. @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_CONSOLE@
-- This is checked for /any/ non-empty value. If set, then all trace output will
-- be directed to the system logger process.
--
-- 3. @DISTRIBUTED_PROCESS_TRACE_EVENTLOG@
-- This is checked for /any/ non-empty value. If set, all internal traces are
-- written to the GHC eventlog.
--
-- Users of the /simplelocalnet/ Cloud Haskell backend should also note that
-- because the trace file option only supports trace output from a single node
-- (so as to avoid interleaving), a file trace configured for the master node
-- will prevent slaves from tracing to the file and will need to fall back to
-- the console or eventlog tracers instead.
--
-- Support for writing to the eventlog requires specific intervention to work,
-- without which, written traces are silently dropped/ignored and no output will
-- be generated. The GHC eventlog documentation provides information about
-- enabling, viewing and working with event traces at
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/EventLog>.
