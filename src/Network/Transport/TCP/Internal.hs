-- This sets up a server socket for the specified host and port. Exceptions
-- thrown during setup are not caught.
--
-- Once the socket is created we spawn a new thread which repeatedly accepts
-- incoming connections and executes the given request handler in another
-- thread. If any exception occurs the accepting thread terminates and calls
-- the terminationHandler. Threads spawned for previous accepted connections
-- are not killed.
-- This exception may occur because of a call to 'N.accept', or because the
-- thread was explicitly killed.
--
-- The request handler is not responsible for closing the socket. It will be
-- closed once that handler returns. Take care to ensure that the socket is not
-- used after the handler returns, or you will get undefined behavior
-- (the file descriptor may be re-used).
--
-- The return value includes the port was bound to. This is not always the same
-- port as that given in the argument. For example, binding to port 0 actually
-- binds to a random port, selected by the OS.
