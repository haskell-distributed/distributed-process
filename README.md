# network-transport-inmemory
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/network-transport-inmemory.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-transport-inmemory)

network-transport-inmemory is a transport for local
communication in the same address space (i.e. a single operating system process). This is useful for testing purposes or for local communication that requires the network-transport semantics.

*NB*: network-transport-inmemory does not support cross-transport
communication. All endpoints that want to communicate should be created using
the same transport.
